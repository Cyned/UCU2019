sentiment**: we used a classifier to assign each example into a polarity class. But we actually have another categorical feature at our disposal - sentiment. Here classes actually represent a scale and the underlying value (positive/negative) could be well mapped into a continuous range. We could make use of this property by computing a regression ([DNN Regressor](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/learn/DNNRegressor)) instead of a classification ([DNN Classifier](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/learn/DNNClassifier)).\n","2. **Larger module**: for the purposes of this tutorial we used a small module to restrict the memory use. There are modules with larger vocabularies and larger embedding space that could give additional accuracy points.\n","3. **Parameter tuning**: we can improve the accuracy by tuning the meta-parameters like the learning rate or the number of steps, especially if we use a different module. A validation set is very important if we want to get any reasonable results, because it is very easy to set-up a model that learns to predict the training data without generalizing well to the test set.\n","4. **More complex model**: we used a module that computes a sentence embedding by embedding each individual word and then combining them with average. One could also use a sequential module (e.g. [Universal Sentence Encoder](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/2) module) to better capture the nature of sentences. Or an ensemble of two or more TF-Hub modules.\n","5. **Regularization**: to prevent overfitting, we could try to use an optimizer that does some sort of regularization, for example [Proximal Adagrad Optimizer](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/ProximalAdagradOptimizer).\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"fKRNsaO8L50F"},"source":["# Advanced: Transfer learning analysis\n","\n","Transfer learning makes it possible to **save training resources** and to achieve good model generalization even when **training on a small dataset**.
